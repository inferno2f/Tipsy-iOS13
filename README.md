# Tipsy-iOS13
Learn to Code While Building Apps - The Complete iOS Development Bootcamp

I've made this app as part of my online Swift 5.0 course.
Tipsy's main goal is to help split the bill between 2+ people in equal proportions.

I tried to implement MVC pattern in this project as well as improve several aspects of the app by going beyond the requirements described in the course.
This is my first app.
